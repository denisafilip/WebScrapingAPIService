# WebScrapingAPIService

This application is a Web Scraping API service that allows users to input a webpage URL and receive structured data scraped from that webpage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that you have a working installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Setting Up and Running the Application

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/backend-directory
    ```

2. Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory with your environment variables, for example:
    ```env
    WEB_SCRAPING_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
    PORT=8080
    ```
    Note: Port 3000 should be reserved for running the frontend of the application.

4. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Frontend Setup:

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/frontend-directory
    ```

2. Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The frontend server should open a new browser window/tab with the application running. If it doesn't, you can manually navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
